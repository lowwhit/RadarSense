# RadarSense
 Radar System with Servo, Ultrasonic Sensor, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi
 
This device has 2 modes of operation :
1) 1 Display ( 16x2 LCD )
2) 2 Displays ( 16x2 LCD and Raspberry Pi 7-inch Display)

For the 1st mode of operation the disp_and_ard.ino code is enough 
For the 2nd mode of operation the 2disp_and_ard.ino and the processing_code_final.pde should be running.

disp_and_ard.ino
This code helps in running the 16x2 LCD that is mounted on the breadboard.

2disp_and_ard.ino
This code helps in running both the Displays ( 16x2 LCD and Raspberry Pi 7-inch Display) , However to view the output the processing_code_final.pde , should be running on the Raspberry Pi / The Host System
